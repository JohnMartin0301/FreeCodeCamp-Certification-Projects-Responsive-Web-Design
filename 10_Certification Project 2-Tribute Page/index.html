        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Albert Einstein was a theoretical physicist of Germany who is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also contributed significantly to the development of quantum mechanics. Albert Einstein is best known for his equation E = mc2, which states that energy and mass (matter) are interchangeable. He is also famous for discovering the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Einstein developed a theory of special and general relativity, which helped to complicate and expand on theories proposed over 200 years before by Isaac Newton.
